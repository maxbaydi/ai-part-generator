[b]AI Part Generator[/b] - ReaScript for REAPER that generates and arranges MIDI parts using AI.

[hr]
[b]What is it[/b]
The script works via a local Python bridge and instrument profiles. It is suitable for quick sketches, orchestration from a sketch, and generating ensembles from scratch.

[b]Features[/b]
[list]
[*]Generate: Single part based on profile, type, style, and mood.
[*]Arrange: Orchestration from a MIDI sketch (distributing material to instruments).
[*]Compose: Multi-track generation from scratch.
[*]Prompt Enhancer: Expand text prompts considering context.
[*]Instrument profiles with articulations (CC/keyswitch/none) and ranges.
[/list]

[b]Requirements[/b]

[*]REAPER with ReaScript support.
[*]ReaImGui for the full interface (otherwise a simplified dialog is used).
[*]Python + bridge dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn.
[*]Model access: Local (LM Studio) or OpenRouter (API key required).
[/list]
